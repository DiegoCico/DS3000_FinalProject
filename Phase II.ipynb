    "How does the stock market work? how can you predict the stock market? what tools can you use? The stock market can seem complex and unpredictable, some would even say gambeling. One of the hardest challenges is making educated or informed decisions. The goal of this project is to tackle the uncertainty and help, stock traders make better decision on wether a stock is tradable or not. Wether to buy or sell. I would use past historical trends to make educated predictions on how the stock market would react."

    "The bimodal distribution observed in the log returns suggests volatility clustering, where the market exhibits frequent up or down movements, with fewer instances of no change. This non-linear behavior makes it challenging to use such features effectively in linear regression, as the model assumes a linear relationship between variables. The two peaks around zero highlight the market’s preference to shift rather than remain flat, reflecting non-stationary behavior. Also the data is shifted to the right slightly because stocks in general return positive returns over long time frames."

    "This table provides the correlations between closeing price for the day, volume of shares trades, technical indicators (like rsi, ema, vwap, adx), and sentiment score for each day the Amazon stock is traded. Based on these correlations, we can determine which variables have the strongest relationships, which gives us a better understanding of the data when analyzing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Notable Relationships:**\n",
    "1. **Close and EMA (exponential moving average):** The high correlation of 0.904341 suggests that EMA can be a valuable indicator in predicting the closing price of Amazon's stock. This relationship makes sense the EMA is calulated using data from historical prices. This allows investors to confidently use the EMA as part of strategies to predict price movements, identify trends, and make informed decisions on entry and exit points for their trades.  \n",
    "2. **EMA and VWAP (volume weighted average price):** This relationship has a strong positive correlation of 0.907945. EMA tracks trends purely based on price, while vwap also takes volume of shares into consideration. This strong relationship suggests that price movements are well supported by trading volumes. This signals to investors good times to buy/sell a stock.    \n",
    "3. **VWAP and ADX (average directional index):** There is a moderate inverse relationship between these two factors, suggested by a correlation of -0.464629. ADX is used to measure the strength of a trend. As the VWAP increases, the ADX tends to decrease, which makes sense because with a higher trading volume comes greater uncertainty and prices may be more scattered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation between technichal indicators and sentiment scores were also an area of interest for our group, however there does not appaer to be a strong relationship between any. Therefore, this tells us that the sentiment of recent news articles many not have a significant impact on stock trends. "
